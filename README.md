# unit-4-game

This is an interactive game using JavaScript and jQuery. 

A random target number is assigned, and the player must try to reach that number (but not exceed it) by clicking on four crystals that contain mystery values. It is kind of like the game Blackjack, in a way. If the player reaches the number, they win! If the player exceeds the number, they lose.

Enjoy!
